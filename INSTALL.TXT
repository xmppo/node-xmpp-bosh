| Installing node-xmpp-bosh |
+---------------------------+

NOTE: Debian and Debian-based system users may use the following 
detailed step-by-step instructions on how-to to install node-xmpp-bosh:
http://code.google.com/p/node-xmpp-bosh/wiki/DebianHowTo


1. Install node.js http://nodejs.org/
(possibly at /opt/node-VERSION so that you can have multiple versions)
node-xmpp-bosh has been tested with node v0.4.x

2. Set the node executable in the path (if not already set):
$ export PATH=/opt/PATH-TO-NODE/bin/:$PATH
(also add to .bashrc)

3. Set the NODE_PATH variable:
$ export NODE_PATH=/opt/PATH-TO-NODE/lib/node_modules/:$NODE_PATH
(also add to .bashrc)

4. Test node:
$ node

5. Install npm: https://github.com/isaacs/npm
curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh

6. If you are a developer, goto step [10]

7. Get the proxy (this should get all deps.) and run it.

Go to the directory where you want to install 
node-xmpp-bosh (for a local install and move to 
setp-9) or follow step-8

$ cd ~/
$ npm install node-xmpp-bosh
$ node node_modules/node-xmpp-bosh/run-server.js

8. Install globally and run
$ npm install node-xmpp-bosh -g
$ bosh-server

9. Report any bugs to dhruvbird@gmail.com


* If you are a developer and want a bleeding edge version of the server, 
pull it from SVN and link it to your node module using npm.

10. $ cd <your project directory>

11. $ svn checkout http://node-xmpp-bosh.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ node-xmpp-bosh-read-only

12. $ cd node-xmpp-bosh-read-only

13. Link the SVN version of the proxy to the main one (so that you can 
pull and needn't wait for a release)
$ npm link

14. Set the executable flag on run-server.js:
$ chmod +x run-server.js

15. Goto step [9]
